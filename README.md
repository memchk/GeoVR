# GeoVR
Geographical Virtual Radio

## Purpose

The Geo VR solution provides a client/server implementation simulating VHF radio.

Although designed to be used as the replacement 'voice codec' for VATSIM this project has other uses such as Amatuer Radio simulation.

## Technology

GeoVR is written using the very 'anti faff' ZeroMQ in C#.  There is a .NET interface as well as a native C++ DLL allowing it to be called from both .NET applications or any C++ application natively.
